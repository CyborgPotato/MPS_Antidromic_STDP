* Implementation of Antidromic Motorunit Model
  This is a basic implementation of a compartmental antidromic motor
  unit model based off the work of
  cite:cisi08_simul_system_spinal_cord_motor modified to include STDP
  for long term plasticity based off the work of
  cite:pedrosa17_role_neurom_cortic_plast.

** Running:
   To use the model refer to ~main.py~.
   
   *Important:* Neurons are connected in reverse
   i.e. ~neuron1.connect(neuron2)~ connects ~neuron1~ and ~neuron2~ such
   that ~neuron2~ synapses onto ~neuron1~'s dendrite.
